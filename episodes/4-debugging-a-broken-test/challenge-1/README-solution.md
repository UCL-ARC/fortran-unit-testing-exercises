# Episode 4 - Challenge 1 - Solution: Debugging a failing unit test

## 1. Which tests are failing?

The error messages from each of the frameworks shown below are all pointing to the same
issue. The test that checks that a 3x3 asymmetric matrix is transposed is failing.

#### Veggies

The output indicates that the failing test relates to `transpose` and, more
specifically, is testing that `a matrix is transposed as expected`.

```

                      [0.0, 0.0, 1.0]]|

1 of 1 cases failed

```

#### test-drive

Similarly to the Veggies test, the test-drive output shown below indicates
that the failing test relates to `transpose` and, more specifically, is
testing  a `3x3 asymmetric matrix`.

```
# Running testdrive tests suite

```


#### pFUnit

Again, the pFUnit output shown below indicates that the failing test is from the
`test_transpose_suite` testsuite and, more specifically, is testing a 
`3x3 Asymmetric` matrix.

```

Total Test time (real) =   0.02 sec

The following tests FAILED:
          2 - pfunit_transpose_tests (Failed)
Errors while running CTest
```

## 2. What is causing these failures? Is it the test(s) or the src code?

The tests appear to be correct as we are inputting

```F90
input_matrix(1,:) = [1,4,0]
input_matrix(2,:) = [6,1,0]
input_matrix(3,:) = [0,3,1]
```

and expect the transposed version to be

```F90
expected_output_matrix(1,:) = [1,6,0]
expected_output_matrix(2,:) = [4,1,3]
expected_output_matrix(3,:) = [0,0,1]
```

Therefore, the problem likely lies in the src code itself. Taking a closer look at
`matrix_transforms::transpose` we can see the issue. When we are transposing
`temp_matrix` into `matrix` we are not flipping the order of the indices, but this is
required to populate the transpose. This also explains why the test(s) of the 3x3
identity matrix are not failing as the identity is a symmetric matrix and is equal to
its own transpose, thus the order of the indices would not matter.

## 3. Fix the tests/src.

We can fix the src with the following change

```diff
--- a/episodes/4-debugging-a-broken-test/challenge-1/src/matrix_transforms.f90
