    ! TASK: Write a function which returns and array of the parameter type you defined above for testing
    !       game_of_life::check_for_steady_state including tests of the following scenarios.
    !
    !       1. Matching boards full of zeros are in steady state
    !       2. Matching boards full of ones are in steady state
    !       3. Matching boards with up to 10 ones are in steady state
    !       4. Mismatched boards with the first all zeros and the other all ones is not in steady state
    !       5. Mismatched boards with the first all zeros and the other all ones is not in steady state
    !       6. Mismatched boards with up to 10 differences is not in steady state
