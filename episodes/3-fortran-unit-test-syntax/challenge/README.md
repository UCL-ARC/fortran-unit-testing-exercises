# Fortran Unit Test Syntax - Challenge: Rewrite veggies tests using test-drive and pFUnit

In [src](./src/) there is a copy of [the src from the episode-2 solution](../../2-intro-to-fortran-unit-tests/solution/src/).
You will also find a copy of [the veggies tests from the episode-2 solution](../../2-intro-to-fortran-unit-tests/solution/test/)
in [test/veggies](./test/veggies/)

Now, take a look at the partially implemented tests within [test/pfunit](./test/pfunit/) and [test/test-drive](./test/test-drive/). The sections to be completed have
been labelled by comments prefixed with `TASK`.

## Tasks

1. Implement the unfinished sections in test/pfunit.
2. Implement the unfinished sections in test/test-drive.
