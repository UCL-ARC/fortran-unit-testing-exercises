# Fortran Unit Test Syntax - Challenge: Rewrite veggies tests using test-drive and pFUnit

In [src](./src/) there is a copy of [the src from the episode-2 solution](../../../2-intro-to-fortran-unit-tests/challenge-1/solution/src/).
You will also find a copy of [the veggies tests from the episode-2 solution](../../../2-intro-to-fortran-unit-tests/challenge-1/solution/test/)
in [veggies-test](./veggies-test/)

Now, take a look at the partially implemented tests within [pfunit-test](./pfunit-test/) and [test-drive-test](./test-drive-test/). The sections to be completed have
been labelled by comments prefixed with `TASK`.

## Tasks

1. Implement the unfinished sections in pfunit-test.
2. Implement the unfinished sections in test-drive-test.
