# Fortran Unit Test Syntax - Challenge: Rewrite veggies tests using test-drive and pFUnit

This exercise aims to teach how to write unit tests using [pFUnit](https://github.com/Goddard-Fortran-Ecosystem/pFUnit),
[test-drive](https://github.com/fortran-lang/test-drive) and [veggies](https://gitlab.com/everythingfunctional/veggies)

## The code

In [src](./src/) there is a copy of [the src from the episode-2 solution](../../2-intro-to-fortran-unit-tests/solution/src/).
You will also find a copy of [the veggies tests from the episode-2 solution](../../2-intro-to-fortran-unit-tests/solution/test/)
in [test/veggies](./test/veggies/)

## Tasks

Now, take a look at the partially implemented tests within [test/pfunit](./test/pfunit/) and [test/test-drive](./test/test-drive/).
The sections to be completed have been labelled by comments prefixed with `TASK`.

1. Implement the unfinished sections in test/pfunit.
2. Implement the unfinished sections in test/test-drive.
